### CREATE AT USER CLASS####

	##Requirements:
		#The user class should initialize with an email, password and birthdate

		#The user class should have reader & writer methods for:
			#Name
			#Location
			#Status


		#Call a method in the initialize that confirms the password
			#First, create a method that prompts the user for input via the terminal
			#Then, compare that user input with password that was created initially
				#If the passwords match, say 'Welcome!'.
			 	# If they do not, have the user enter their password again, or give them the option to type exit to not complete the process
			#Call this method in initialize, so that the user has to confirm their password before their signup is complete


		### BONUS / Extra Credit ###
			#Setup a way for a user to store photos
